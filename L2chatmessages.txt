Good morning - we start at 9.15, and will have 15 minute breaks at 10.00 and 11.00. 

I will pause for questions underway. You may also use the chat. I might not see the "raise hand" icon, so safer to write in chat or unmute yourself!

learning resources for this lecture are available as html or slides (to write on)

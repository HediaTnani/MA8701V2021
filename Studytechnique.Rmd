# Organize thoughts and create neural hooks
(From "A mind for numbers")

Before you start to really read and write down and work with the equations and concepts "Prime your mental pump" by a picture walk through the chapter you will study, looking only at the graphics (pictures/graphs) and at the section headings, summaries and questions in the end of each chapter. This will help you organize your thoughts and create "neural hooks" to hang your thinking on.
